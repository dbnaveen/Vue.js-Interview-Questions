#### Two-Way Data Binding in Vue With v-model

- Vue supports two way data binding via the `v-model` property
- It's a powerful pattern for `building Javascript forms with vue`.

For example, you have an input element and a variable called name. Two way data binding means:

1. When the user types in the input element, the name gets updated to match the value in the input
2. When you update the name, the input elements content gets updated
